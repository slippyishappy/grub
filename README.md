# Productivity Site

The website is a personal productivity dashboard with a clean and minimal UI. It includes a fixed top navigation bar with links and a profile icon, a greeting section with a welcome message and button, and task cards divided into "Today" and "Upcoming" with priority labels and due times. There is a daily goals section with labeled progress bars, a Pomodoro timer UI with buttons, and an inspiration quote block. On larger screens, a sidebar shows quick links, a weekly task overview, and a short notes section. The layout uses containers, grid, and flexbox for responsive design.
